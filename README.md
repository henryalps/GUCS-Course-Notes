# GUCS Code Course Notes

[中文](README-zh.md)

'Ground-Up Computer Science Course Notes' is a repository containing practical code implementations related to the course book Ground-Up Computer Science by Yin Wang. This book provides a comprehensive introduction to some Computer Science topics in an understandable format which will be beneficial for both beginner and advanced learners.

## Table of Contents
 1. Functions
 2. Variables
 3. Function Call
 4. More chapters...

## Description
This repository is a hands-on practical coding approach towards understanding Computer Science. Each chapter inside this repository corresponds to the respective chapter in the 'Ground-Up Computer Science' book.

The coding exercises have been done in Jupyter Notebook, encompassing various chapters of the book. The directory `module.js` is a global dependency that is imported by the other files.

## Prerequisites
- Jupyter Notebook
- Knowledge in Computer Science or interest to learn the same

## Setup
To run this project, install Jupyter Notebook and clone this repository.

## Usage
Each Jupyter notebook coincides with a different chapter from the book. You can run each code cell successively to understand the application of concepts in code or to solve specific problems.

## Contributing
Ideas, and improvements are greatly appreciated and pull requests are welcome. We want to make this a resource for learners pursuing Computer Science.

## Acknowledgments
Heartfelt thanks to Yin Wang for opensourcing book like 'Ground-Up Computer Science.'
